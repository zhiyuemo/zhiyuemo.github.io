## ðŸ“š Pedagogical Approach
- **Active Learning Framework**  
  Combine conceptual lectures with hands-on RStudio sessions

- **Assessment Strategy**  
  Three-tier evaluation system:  
  1. Weekly code reviews  
  2. Midterm data analysis report  
  3. Final replication project

- **Tools Ecosystem**
